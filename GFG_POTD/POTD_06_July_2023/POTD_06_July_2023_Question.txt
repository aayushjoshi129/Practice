Quick Sort

Question) Quick Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot.
Given an array arr[], its starting position is low (the index of the array) and its ending position is high(the index of the array).

Note: The low and high are inclusive.

Implement the partition() and quickSort() functions to sort the array.
