Mastering CSS: Inline, Internal, and External Stylesheets || Episode - 13

1) CSS - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

1.1) INLINE CSS - Styles added in same line where html code is written.
1.2) INTERNAL CSS - Styles added in style section in head section of html file.
1.3) EXTERNAL CSS - Styles added in a seperate file and linked using a link code.

The Order of Competition lies like -  INLINE > INTERNAL > EXTERNAL

But if you check in INTERNAL and EXTERNAL CSS, the game lies in the order of declaration,
the onw which is defined later will win.

2) SELECTOR - Its is a way in which you can target a particular html element and give styling to it.

2.1) Element Selector - using element name - p, h1, h2, footer, span, etc.
2.2) Id Selector - using #{id} (Hash Keyword).
2.3) Class Selector - using .{id} (Dot Operator).
2.4) Group Selector - using , (comma).

Css depends on
1. Specificity :- means priority of selectors 
Inline css > id > class > element
2. !important 
3. Order in which csss declared , the last one have higher priority
4. Inheritance means some css properties will apply on all the elements inside the selector like color but some not like border
