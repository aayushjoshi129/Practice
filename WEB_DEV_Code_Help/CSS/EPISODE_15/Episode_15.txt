CSS "Box Model" in 40 minutes || Complete Web Dev Course || Episode - 15

1) Box Model - Any content that is present in the browser, will always render in a box.

1.1) Content - The data that is present on browser.
1.2) Padding - The padding CSS shorthand property sets the padding area on all four sides of an element at once
1.3) Border - The border shorthand CSS property sets an element's border. It sets the values of border-width, border-style, and border-color.
1.4) Margin - The margin CSS shorthand property sets the margin area on all four sides of an element.

2) Box Sizing - The box-sizing CSS property sets how the total width and height of an element is calculated.

BOX-SIZING - BORDER BOX  -   It is often useful to set box-sizing to border-box to lay out elements. This makes dealing with the sizes of elements much easier, and generally eliminates a number of pitfalls you can stumble on while laying out your content. On the other hand, when using position: relative or position: absolute, use of box-sizing: content-box allows the positioning values to be relative to the content, and independent of changes to border and padding sizes, which is sometimes desirable.

You do not need to calculate out the CSS box-model anymore.

You can easily add large padding to an object without have to re-fix your height/width
