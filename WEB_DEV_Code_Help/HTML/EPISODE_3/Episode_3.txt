EPISODE 3 - How the INTERNET Works - A Simple Explanation || Episode - 3

1) HISTORY OF INTERNET 
1.1) ARPANET - 1960 (to send data in form of small chunks(packets) from src to dest) (Developed by Department of Defence)
1.2) 1970 - It is being used at Institutions level, organizational levels 
1.3) 1980 - DNS (Domain Name Server) (Convert URL, string, domain_name to IP Address)
1.4) 1990 - Commercialization of Internet (Emails, Messaging, Shopping etc)
1.5) 2000 - Facebook, Rise of Mobile Phones 

2) ISP (Internet Service Provider) - Client sends requests to ISP and then ISP access the IP Address on behalf of client to give response. It provides an IP over network.
2.1) Local ISP - contains local web IP addresses and if unable to fulfill the request it sends it to Regional ISP
2.2) Regional ISP - contains regional web IP addresses and if unable to fulfill the request it sends it to National Service Provider
2.3) NSP(National Service Provider) - It gives authority to various ISP to provide service and has all Web IP Addresses.

3) Protocols - set of rules that is being followed when transfering data. ex- TCP/IP/HTTP/SMTP/POP/FTP

4) OSI(Open System Interconnection) model(7 layers) is just a reference model that are used to understand how our data is transfered over the network, but the actual implemented model is TCP/IP(5 layers).

APSTNDP (Aj Phir Se Test Nahi Dena Padega) 
(Application Layer)
(Presentation Layer)
(Session Layer)
(Transport Layer)
(Network Layer)
(Data Link Layer)
(Physical Layer)

5) Switch - A switch is a multiport bridge with a buffer and a design that can boost its efficiency(a large number of ports imply less traffic) and performance.

6) Hub –  A hub is a basically multi-port repeater. A hub connects multiple wires coming from different branches, for example, the connector in star topology which connects different stations. Hubs cannot filter data, so data packets are sent to all connected devices. 

7) Repeater - A repeater operates at the physical layer. Its job is to regenerate the signal over the same network before the signal becomes too weak or corrupted to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network.

8) Bridge - A bridge operates at the data link layer. A bridge is a repeater, with add on the functionality of filtering content by reading the MAC addresses of the source and destination.

9) Routers – A router is a device like a switch that routes data packets based on their IP addresses. The router is mainly a Network Layer device.

10) Gateway – A gateway, as the name suggests, is a passage to connect two networks that may work upon different networking models. They work as messenger agents that take data from one system, interpret it, and transfer it to another system.

11) Brouter – It is also known as the bridging router is a device that combines features of both bridge and router. It can work either at the data link layer or a network layer.

12) NIC – NIC or network interface card is a network adapter that is used to connect the computer to the network. It is installed in the computer to establish a LAN.

13) Modem - A modem converts data to a signal so it can be easily sent and received over a phone line, cable, or satellite connection. 

14) How Packet Travels Over Internet - 
Browser -> req -> Local ISP -> Regional ISP -> National Service Provider -> Router -> ... -> Server

15) IPv4 has a 32-bit address length.	
IPv6 has a 128-bit address length.
Generally, IPv6 is faster than IPv4. However, when we go to a larger packet size, IPv6 can be slow in some cases.
need of ipv6 is to improve security and support for mobile devices
